# Cytron-SHIELD-ROBO-UNO
If you are new to [Cytron Product Name] and want to get started quickly, you are in the right place! Here you will find all the information you need to set up your hardware and software and start coding with the [Cytron Product Name].  

## Requirements  
To get started, you will need the following hardware and software:  
**Hardware:**  
* [Maker Pi Pico](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-pico) or [Maker Pi Pico Base](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-pico-nb)  
* [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/)  
* [OLED Display SSD1306](https://my.cytron.io/p-oled-i2c-0.96inch-128x64-blue-display)  
* [3V3 I2C and SPI 1602 Serial Character LCD](https://my.cytron.io/p-3v3-i2c-and-spi-1602-serial-character-lcd)  


**Software:**  
To upload the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico you need an IDE such as [Micropython](https://micropython.org/download/).
These codes were written in python, if your operating system don't have it you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation 
Inside the python file display_oled.py, edit the pin if you are using different port:

```python
i2c = io.I2C(board.GP1, board.GP0)
```
